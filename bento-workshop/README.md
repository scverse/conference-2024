## Abstract
The goal of this workshop is to demonstrate how spatial transcriptomics data can be used to extract subcellular insights about cell biology, primarily emphasizing analysis with Bento – a package in the Scverse ecosystem – that utilizes the SpatialData framework enabling interoperability with Scanpy and Squidpy. The workshop will include a brief intro to spatial transcriptomics technologies capable of subcellular measurements. Then we will introduce hands-on exercises (Jupyter notebooks) for spatial analysis, such as annotating subcellular spatial patterns and domains, gene colocalization, and measuring cell morphology. We will conclude with a short Q&A session for more open-ended discussion.
